// Eloquent JS Chapter 3 - Functions

// Minimum - Consider Math.min. Write a function that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.


/*
Recursion - Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to the following description.
- Zero is even, one is odd
- For any other number N, its eveness is the same as N - 2
- The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.
- Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?

/* 
Bean counting
1. Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase 'B' characters there are in a string.
2. Write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting uppercase 'B' characters.) Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
